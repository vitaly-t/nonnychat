            Let's include our nonnychat JavaScript and CSS files.
            Note that these are in that public folder that can be accessed directly by URL
            This is why we did that... now we can just link to them the normal way as below:
        -->
        <script src="/public/nonnychat.js"></script>
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/public/nonnychat.css" />

        <!--
            Here we're going to have a button to toggle some instructions open and closed, followed by a div containing some paragraphs with those instructions. The JS file above has some code that enables toggling those open and closed I won't go into any more detail about that, since it's not specifically relevant to the tutorial.
        -->
        <a href="javascript:;" id="btnToggleInstructions">Info / Instructions</a>
        <div id="instructions">
            <p>
                Pick any ROOM and NAME that you'd like. Anyone else who picks the same ROOM (case-sensitive!) will see any messages that you type in the form that appears, with the NAME that you choose next to them.
            </p>
            <p>
                None of these messages are stored anywhere, in a database or otherwise. They're just broadcast out to anyone whose browser has made a websocket connection using the same ROOM value as you. Newcomers to the room won't see old messages, and if you leave and come back you'll miss anything that was said in between.
            </p>

        <!--
        Here we find a login div. Logging into this app is simple a matter of picking any 'room' name and a 'username' to go by. These values are then submitted to the server when a websocket connection is made. Any messages you send to the server will be handled as coming from [name] and being broadcast out to anyone else who has an active websocket connection using the same [room] value.
        -->
        <div id="login">
            <div class="inline">Room: <input type='text' id='room' /></div>

        Once someone logs in and creates a websocket connection, the login div is hidden and this one is shown instead, so they can disconnect (and "log out").

        THIS WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT PLACE TO USE A VUE COMPONENT.

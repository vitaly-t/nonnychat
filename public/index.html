        Let's include the Vue.js framework. 
        We'll use this just a little bit, to display the chat log.
        Just a nice way to get our toes wet without diving into a Vue.js tutorial, too.

            Let's include our nonnychat JavaScript and CSS files.
            Note that these are in that public folder that can be accessed directly by URL
            This is why we did that... now we can just link to them the normal way as below:

            Here we're going to have a button to toggle some instructions open and closed, followed by a div containing some paragraphs with those instructions. The JS file above has some code that enables toggling those open and closed I won't go into any more detail about that, since it's not specifically relevant to the tutorial.

            <p>
                None of these messages are stored anywhere, in a database or otherwise. They're just broadcast out to anyone whose browser has made a websocket connection using the same ROOM value as you. Newcomers to the room won't see old messages, and if you leave and come back you'll miss anything that was said in between.

        Here we find a login div. Logging into this app is simple a matter of picking any 'room' name and a 'username' to go by. These values are then submitted to the server when a websocket connection is made. Any messages you send to the server will be handled as coming from [name] and being broadcast out to anyone else who has an active websocket connection using the same [room] value.

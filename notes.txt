___ Refactor to allow specifying the 'room' by going to a URL instead

___ Add a logout action that can be sent from the server and executed locally

___ How could "ownership" of room names be established in a temporary way so that people can invite users somehow? That would be a cool functionality.

___ Factor in some google login or something? Firebase?? Would this actually be used to store anything? Or just for advertising identification?
